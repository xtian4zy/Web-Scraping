# Implementing Web-Scraping Using Python - Lab
---
## Introduction
---
In this lab you'll carry out pratical implementation of web scraping using the Python programming language. You will install and import (load) the required libraries for web scraping and then scrape data from a wikipedia website. Finally, you will convert the scraped data from raw html table into pandas dataframe that can now be used easily for any further analysis. Let's get started!

## Objectives
---
You will be able to:

- Gather data from online sources using web scraping.
- Make practical application of Python libraries used for web scraping.
- Extract data from a given format (raw html) into a destired format (dataframe).
- Export the extracted data for further use.

##What is Web Scraping?
